# EV infrastructure
This project identifies the physical locations of commercial EV charging stations.

#### -- Project Status [In-process]

## Problem Definition and Motivation
Unlike gasoline fueling stations, EV charging stations are not ubiquitous across the continental United States. We believe an increase in the availability of commercial charging stations is likely to increase the adoption of EVs. The creation of EV charging stations brings new challenges: charging time for vehicles vs stress on the local grid system, the number of charging stations vs strain on the local grid system, location to best serve driving behavior, and construction costs. There are abundant governmental incentives to build EV charging stations to increase the adaption of EVs.

##### Project objectives
1. To collect, clean, and comprehend commercial EV charging stations data  (GIS data and available features).
2. Merge additional more granular charging station datasets
3. Understand the relevance and use cases of each dataset's features.
4. Graphicly visualize station location and its key features.
5. Investigate any correlation between other (voting, population, transportation congestion) location-based data sets and the placement of these EV charging stations.
